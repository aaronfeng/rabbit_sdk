** client API

three layers 

We need this for .net initially, and Java at some later point

*** DONE standard RMQ client API
*** TODO reliable, available, asynchronous, point-to-point conversation API

in turn comprised of three sub-layers

**** TODO reliable connection/channel

at-least-once delivery in the presence of
- server and network failures
- sender and recipient failures 

- same api as normal connection/channel
- channels keeps track of
  - subscriptions
  - tx mode or checkpoint mode
  - qos prefetch
  - publishes since last commit/cancel / checkpoint, or during last n ms
    (depending on mode)
  - pending acks
- automatically reconnects in the event of errors that are not the
  client/app's fault
- on reconnect the channels are re-opened and for each channel
  - the tx/checkpoint mode is (re)selected
  - the qos prefetch is (re)set
  - subscriptions are recreated
  - buffered publishes are resent
- acks for messages delivered in a previous (i.e. not the current)
  session are silently dropped (or, rather, we drop all acks that
  aren't pending) - otherwise the server would reject
  them with an error
- callback to notify app when broker is deemed to have accepted
  responsibilty for a message. By persisting this info apps can limit
  the amount of resends they have to do in the event of a client
  failure.
- callbacks for connection and channel lifecycle events - invoked for
  connect, reconnect, disconnect and retry-exceeded events

props:
- reconnect/resend policy
  - retry_interval
  - exponential_backoff_steps
  - maximum retries
  - buffer_duration (keep outbound messages for n ms, in case resend
    is needed)

***** no replay of commands

The trouble with replaying commands is that we may stomp on resources
that have been created/deleted by other connections.

The other problem is that we do not know the state the system was in
at the beginning of the recording.

And, finally, some commands are not idempotent.

-> decision: we only keep track of publishes. Synchronous commands
fail in the event of a disconnect.

async commands issued during a disconnect are silently dropped, except
for publishes.
Q: should publishes be totally async, even in the presence of
  disconnects? Ideally yes, but there is a danger of buffering vast
  volumes of messages during prolonged outages.

**** TODO reliable, asynchronous, point-to-point conversation API

- built on top of reliable connection/channel
- each party has an identity, also serving as their "address"
- parties can send messages to each other
- receiving parties can identify the sender
- messages get given unique ids
- messages can be correlated to other messages
- messages are persistent and all created broker entities are durable

msg = {properties, body}

methods:
- init(connection, optional msg_id_prefix). The msg_id_prefix forms
  the first part of ids created with next_id(). It should be
  monotonically increasing *between runs*. The currrent time is prob
  good enough for most apps, and that's the default. But apps may also
  consider keeping a disk-based counter.
- next_id() - apps can/should use this to populate the message_id
  field. It is important that apps call 'send' with monotonically
  increasing ids.
- send(msg)
- create_subscription() -> subscription. Protected method that is
  called after the channels have been created. The default
  implementation creates a subscription which declares a queue w props
  name=queue, durable=false, exclusive=false, auto-delete=false, and
  binds it to the exchange (unless exchange=="") with bk=identity. The
  method can (and should) be overridden for different behaviours. 
- callback sent(msg) - invoked when broker has accepted
  responsibility
- callback received(msg) - invoked for inbound messages
  -> void/exception;
  - ack is sent if returns w/o exception. what do we do on exception?
    tear down everything? perhaps we should do a basic.reject ... 
  - single-threaded, i.e. only one invocation at a time

props:
- identity, exchange="", exchange_type="direct", queue=identity
- prefetch_limit=0
- readonly connection, sending_channel, receiving_channel
- commit/checkpoint every n msgs / ms, or wait n ms
- 'sent', 'received' and 'lifecycle_event' callback handlers

NB: internally we use *two* channels, one for publishes and one for
deliveries/acks. This keeps the concurrency handling simpler and also
means we can put the publish channel in tx/checkpoint mode w/o
affecting the delivery channel.

**** TODO HA version of the above

Q: Do we need full HA or would standby (plus maybe SAN) be sufficient?

creates queues on multiple nodes, subscribes to all of them, and acks
& throws away all received messages sent by the same sender with an id
less than or equal of an already received id. NB: the acking should
only happen after the original message has been ack'ed.

Q: how can we make this work reasonably efficient in a workload
distribution scenario?

PS: when there are multiple workers operating on a message stream,
they send replies the message ids are only unique per worker. That
means they need to identify themselves as a different *sender*, but
set the reply-to to the common address.

*** TODO algo collateral messaging API

** protocol

A -> B: msg(id)
A <- : notification(id, stage)
A <- : ...
B -> A: msg(in-reply-to:id, id)
B <- : notification(id, stage)
B <- : ...

NB: because delivery notifications are sent from multiple agents,
  message order cannot be guaranteed

*** TODO define collateral protocol
i.e. the stuff that sits on top of the above

*** TODO draw routing topology

*** TODO draw logical message flow
between C1, algo agent, C2

*** TODO sequence diagrams

*** TODO figure out messaging role of algo agent

Is it a proxy, in which case it will pass on messages with their
original from & message-id, or is it a full participant, in which case
in order to get the notifications to work the way we want it will need
to keep a mapping from message ids of the inbound messages to the
message ids of the corresponding outbound messages, so that it can
re-map the ids for notifications sent baxk by the recipient.

Let's assume it is a proxy and experiment with that.

** security

*** TODO define attacker model

*** TODO define threat model

*** TODO investigate encryption options
- is connection-level ssl enough?

*** TODO investigate authentication options

- base level: username & password, and SSL (possibly w h/w crypto)
- client-side certs, and perhaps, two-, or three-factor auth
  - threat: staff leaving client and knowing the rabbit credentials
  - Paul: is this a client-side only thing?

terminating SSL inside rabbit prevents external packet-level filtering

also, cert management in rabbit may be harder than in an external
termination point

**** TODO How do we stop a client from impersonating one another
by
- sending messages under a different (but valid) username/password;
  i.e. if they have managed to get hold of somebody else' creds
- sending messages referencing agreements that do not belong to the
  user they authenticated as?

The only way to guard against that is for the algo agent to obtain a
validated identity of the sender. We could try to get that from a
client cert on the connection, but that requires rabbit to do the ssl
termination, which is something we may want to avoid (see above).

The alternative is to get clients to sign (portions of) the body. That
requires the algo agent to maintain a list of trusted certs.

*** TODO investigate authorisation options

- permissions set such that users cannot create/delete anything, can
  only publish to the appropriate exchanges, and can only consume from
  the appropriate queues
- queue names for clients are strong and clients are told of their
  name at provisioning time. A queue with a new name can be created
  should the the original name ever get compromised.
- may need to use IP whitelisting

** protection against DOS (accidental or deliberate)

*** TODO define threat
what can a user do
- when having no credentials
- when having full credentials

*** TODO figure out how to identify misbehaving clients
- at firewall
- ordinary network monitoring
- rmq stats

*** TODO figure out how to cut off misbehaving clients
- at firewall
- by disabling their rmq account

what kind of packet-level filtering should we consider?

*** TODO RabbitMQ ulimits

** detecting incorrect client behaviour

*** AMQP level
- check log for errors
  - how do we tie this back to users?
    - IP
    - use rabbitmqctl connection info; but must be quick

*** app level
- Algo agent error log/reporting, for app-level errors
  - perhaps just have another X to which errors are sent

** algo agent

** provisioning tool
provisions the queue(s) for every client
provisions record of all agreements

** web i/f
*** UI interactions
*** UI design
*** back-end
*** f/e - b/e communication

** testing

** deployment

** operational monitoring

** billing

** archiving

** recovering from app-level failures
manual intervention that needs to bring the state of the three
parties back in sync

** system upgrades

** scaling

*** TODO get some estimates of baseline, peak, growth
1M msg per day + 3m notifications

<20% of agreements generate a margin call on any given day

biggest client: 20k, planned to rise to 100k
avg: 1k, expected to rise
500 clients

msg size: ?

** IM

* possible rabbit extensions

** MSBuild

for .net client, since nant scares Windows people.

Apparently msbuild can work under mono too.

It is useful to have an msbuild, rather than just the dll in the GAC,
because it allows source-level debugging in VS.

** DL{Q,E}

For messages that get redelivered too often. See spec of basic.deliver
for some hints. The limit & dlq name would be configured on a
per-queue basis by specifying a property at queue creation time.

The redelivery counter will need to be persistent.

NB: the advantage of DLQs over re-publishing the message to a
different exchange is that all the meta information can be preserved
in the former case whereas we'd have to create a wrapper otherwise.

OTOH, DLEs would be far more flexible...
...and we already have invented a mechanism for preserving the meta
information - namely the exchange name - for alternate exchanges.

So let's go with DLEs instead.

** stats / accounting

Record stats on usage of system

- per user connection and channel counters
- per connection frame and data volume counters (in & out)
- per channel command counter (inbound and outbound)
  - perhaps further broken down by command
- per queue msg counter (in & out)

channels and connections reference users, so aggregation by user is possible

** ulimits

- #conns per second (1st derivative of connection counter)
- #concurrent connections
- #channel creations per second (1st derivative of channel counter)
- #concurrent channels
- #commands per second (first derivative of command counter)
  - perhaps further broken down by command (ditto)
- amount of inbound data per second (first derivative of data volume counter)
NB: we don't say anything about queues here. That's because queues,
and the messages in them, aren't really owned by anybody.

For the rate-based limits, we may want to allow bursts of activity.

Since these are *u*limits, perhaps we should have a process per user
to keep track of these.

Should these limits be per cluster or per host?

** end-to-end acks

How can we get an ack all the way back to the publisher?

We could get the consumer to publish an ack message, but that seems
redundant when it is already sending and ack for the message. OTOH, an
application level ack is not always aligned with the messaging level
ack, so using the latter for the former is not always right.

** SSL

* possible rabbit bugs

** WSAETIMEDOUT error in CreateConnection ([[bug:21201]])
...when establishing lots of connections and running tight publish
loops in them.
[[http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/170046-46-wsaetimedout][Google says]] that this is probably due to the connection timing
out. Apparently there are some registry settings and possible params
to tweak...though it turns out that registry setting has been
removed. "using an asynchronous client socket" (google for it) may
help, though I suspect all that's going to happen is that the error
gets reported asynchronously.

** exception indicating missing inbound heartbeat in .net client ([[bug:21203]])
This happens when the client is sending a lot of messages. One reason
this may happen is if the mainloop doesn't get enough cycles.
I tried increasing the Mainloop thread priority, but that didn't make
a difference.
Running the same test on a faster machine (quad core, rather than a VM
on some old dual core), made the problem go awway :(

** when rabbit is very busy, rabbitmqctl can time out ([[bug:21202]])
with a {badrpc,timeout}


* resolved

** persistent vs non-persistent

With persistence we can shorten the duration for which a producer
needs to hang on to a message for GD - rather than having to wait
until the ultimate consumer confirms receipt, the producer just needs
to ensure it waits long enough for the message to get written to disk
by the broker.

** one user vs several

several, since it makes it easier to disable access. Also, if we only
had one username/password then if that gets compromised, potentially
allowing anybody to access the system, we'd have to ask all clients to
change their creds. Plus if we ever do add some more stats/accounting
functionality to rabbit then keying some of it on the user makes sense.

** number of queues per logical client

one - at the messaging level there is no distinction between requests,
replies and notifications.
